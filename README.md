# Voice-Assistant

This repository contains a Python program for a Virtual Assistant that utilizes speech recognition, web scraping, and text-to-speech capabilities to interact with the user and provide information.

## Features
Speech recognition to capture user input.
Text-to-speech functionality to communicate with the user.
Web scraping to search for information and provide answers.
Weather forecast retrieval based on user input.

## Prerequisites
Before running the program, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

speech_recognition
pyttsx3
googlesearch-python
requests
beautifulsoup4
You will also need an API key from OpenWeather for the weather forecast feature.

## Getting Started
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/virtual-assistant.git

### Install the required dependencies:
pip install speech_recognition pyttsx3 googlesearch-python requests beautifulsoup4
Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' in the code with your actual OpenWeather API key.

### Run the program:
python virtual_assistant.py

## Usage
The Virtual Assistant will be activated, and it will respond to various user queries and commands.
You can greet the assistant with "hello" and say "goodbye" or "bye" to exit the assistant.
To inquire about the weather, ask for the forecast of a specific city and optionally mention "today," "tomorrow," or any day of the week.
The assistant can answer general questions starting with "what," "who," "where," "when," "why," or "how."
Use "continue" to read the next paragraph of a search result.
